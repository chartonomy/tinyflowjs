A lightweight workflow engine for all runtimes.
Highly extensive with minimal core and no dependencies.


## Features

- works with many JavaScript runtimes that support at least ES6 and Promises
- minimal core (xyzkb minified)
- very easy to use API
- highly extensible; writing an extension is a real no-brainer
- use declarative workflows and enrich them with custom functionality

## Installation

## Usage

Internally there are two classes, `Workflow` and `Step` that act for the whole engine.

### Events

| Class    | Name      | Info                                                                                                     | Data |
|----------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| Workflow | `started` | fired when the workflow has started, after all extensions were executed without error                    | 
| Workflow | `step`    | fired when a new step has entered                                                                        |
| Workflow | `end`     | fired when the workflow ended; read the workflow state to know whether it ended by complete or by cancel |
| Workflow | `error`   | fired when an error has been caught                                                                      |


### Examples

#### A simple log extension

```js
Tinyflow.use('log', ({ workflow, step }) => {
  if (workflow) {
    workflow.on('')
  }
  if (step) {
    
  }
})
```

#### Restore

```js
const restore = (definitions, snapshot) => {
  if (instances.has(snapshot.id)) {
    throw new TinyflowError(`There is already an active workflow by id ${snapshot.id}`)
  }

  const instanceId = snapshot.id
  const wfOptions = { instanceId }
  const wf = Tinyflow.create(definitions, wfOptions)
  wf.start()
  wf.step(snapshot.current.name, { stepId: snapshot.current.id })

  if (typeof snapshot.current.data === 'object') {
    wf.current.update(snapshot.current.data)
  }

  return wf
}
```
